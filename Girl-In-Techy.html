        Girls in Tech is a nonprofit organization that aims to stop gender inequality in the tech industry by empowering women through coding courses, bootcamps, and hackathons for girls and women of all ages and professions. The mission is to “support women with the access and community they need to succeed in tech.” The organization started in San Francisco in 2007 and has since grown to include more than 62,000 members in 33 countries. Events and programs vary by chapter and are designed to suit the specific needs of each community.</p>

            <p class="even">I feel that girls and boys, when they’re young, are all interested in STEM. Kids want to build and create. But, as time goes on, it becomes less and less equal. Girls aren’t encouraged in the same way as boys, and, when being advised on careers, girls are often told they shouldn’t study STEM. Lack of support from parents and teachers is discouraging. A lack of female role models in the field they’re interested in doesn’t help, either.</p>

            <p class="odd">t’s a new era for women. Nowadays, us girls grow up hearing we can do anything, be anything. And yet, there is still not enough women in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) to create equality. Only 29% of STEM jobs are occupied by women.  Why? Girls have just as much potential, and just as much interest in STEM as boys do. It’s simple. Unconscious gender bias. People don’t even realize that they’re doing it. Helen Chiang, who is studio head for the Minecraft franchise, said that, when she was in school, “it wasn’t popular for girls to be smart or interested in challenging subjects within STEM.” There are social and cultural barriers that often keep girls form entering STEM subjects and careers. Popularity is one of them. Another is the pressure to prove themselves in a room filled with men, whilst being seen as an outsider</p>

            <p class="even">I believe that women and girls are just as capable as men, and that empowering young girls is incredibly important if we want to create a sustainable future for our planet.</p>

            <p>While the study identified the challenges women pursuing tech careers face, it also highlighted the actions that can make a positive difference. Encouraging teachers, parents and other role models can influence girls and young women to enter tech despite pervasive gender stereotypes about the industry. The 19th spoke with Girls Who Code CEO Tarika Barrett about why role models matter and the ramifications of sexism in tech. </p>

            <p>With technology playing a role in all kinds of careers, from art and history to law, primary teaching and graphic design, learning tech skills at a young age will set girls up for economic independence. And, the ICT sector needs more girls and women.

                The jobs of the future will be driven by technology and innovation—65 per cent of children entering primary school today will have jobs that do not yet exist. 
                
                Girls want to learn, they are stepping up to the plate to learn tech skills, and empowering others to join. Girls like 16-year-old Jakomba, who has started a robotics club at her school in the Gambia; Nino, who arranges hackathons for young girls in Georgia; and Eno, who built a drone at a coding camp in Ethiopia.
